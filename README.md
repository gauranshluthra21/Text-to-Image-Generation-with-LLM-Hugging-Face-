# Text-to-Image-Generation-with-LLM-Hugging-Face-

Text-to-Image Generation using NLP & Computer Vision
In here, I explored the fascinating intersection of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV) by implementing a text-to-image generation model. The model takes textual descriptions as input and generates corresponding images, leveraging state-of-the-art techniques in transformers and generative AI.

**Key Features:**
Text Encoding: Utilizes advanced NLP models to process and understand text prompts.
Image Generation: Implements generative models like DALLÂ·E or Stable Diffusion to create high-quality images from textual input.
Hugging Face Integration: Includes pre-trained models from Hugging Face, allowing easy experimentation and fine-tuning.
Check out the project to see how text descriptions can be turned into images using cutting-edge AI models. Feel free to explore, contribute, or adapt this for your own use cases!
